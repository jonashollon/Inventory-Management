# Inventory-Management
First project for Code Louisville

I run a store on ebay so naturally my first thought for a project were to do something related to that.
This is a console app in c# which is able to add, edit, and remove products in your inventory as well as adding in a method that checks to see
if you have any products nearing or past expiration.

While this app would probably be better served with an actual UI rather than as a console app, I think it's a pretty good way for me to test
and show the skills that I learned in the first session of our software dev bootcamp course.

Anyone with any feedback or anything to add, don't hesitate to message me. I'd love feedback as I am still very much a beginner and
still learning.
